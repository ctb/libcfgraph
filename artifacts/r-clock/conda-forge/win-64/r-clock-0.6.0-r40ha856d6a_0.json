  "summary": "Provides a comprehensive library for date-time manipulations using a new family of orthogonal date-time classes (durations, time points, zoned-times, and calendars) that partition responsibilities so that the complexities of time zones are only considered when they are really needed. Capabilities include: date-time parsing, formatting, arithmetic, extraction and updating of components, and rounding.",
