  "description": "Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical\nterminal between several processes, typically interactive\nshells. Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC\nVT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from\nthe ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g.,\ninsert/delete line and support for multiple character sets). There\nis a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a\ncopy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions\nbetween windows. When screen is called, it creates a single window\nwith a shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of\nyour way so that you can use the program as you normally\nwould. Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen) windows\nwith other programs in them (including more shells), kill the\ncurrent window, view a list of the active windows, turn output\nlogging on and off, copy text between windows, view the scrollback\nhistory, switch between windows, etc. All windows run their\nprograms completely independent of each other. Programs continue\nto run when their window is currently not visible and even when\nthe whole screen session is detached from the users terminal.\nsimplejson is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensible\nJSON <https://json.org> encoder and decoder for Python 2.5+ and\nPython 3.3+. It is pure Python code with no dependencies, but\nincludes an optional C extension for a serious speed boost.\n",
